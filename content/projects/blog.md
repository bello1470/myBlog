# Abstract 

The Blog Website project aims to create a dynamic and interactive platform for users to create, publish, and manage blog posts. Utilizing OAuth2 authentication, the website ensures secure user login through existing accounts such as Google or Facebook. Developed with a Java Spring Boot back-end and a React.js front-end, the project combines robust development practices to deliver a user-friendly interface and efficient data handling.

The application supports features like content creation, editing, and publishing, providing users with a seamless blogging experience. The use of modern web technologies ensures a responsive and engaging interface, while back-end optimizations enhance performance and scalability. This project illustrates the capability of web applications to foster community engagement and knowledge sharing in the digital age.
