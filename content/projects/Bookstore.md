# Abstract 

The Advanced Bookstore Microservices Project is a comprehensive software solution aimed at enhancing the management and operations of a modern bookstore. Leveraging the power of microservices architecture, this project is designed to provide a scalable and robust infrastructure for handling complex business processes. Developed using Java, Spring Framework, and Keycloak, the project integrates with PostgreSQL for secure and efficient data persistence.

The system facilitates seamless communication between front-end and back-end components through RESTful APIs, while ensuring data integrity and security with OAuth2-based authentication. Asynchronous communication is achieved via RabbitMQ, enhancing responsiveness and scalability. Key components such as Spring Cloud Gateway, Resilience4j, and ShedLock-based distributed locking are employed to optimize performance and ensure task execution without conflicts. Monitoring and observability are established using Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo, allowing proactive system issue identification and resolution. Docker and Docker Compose are utilized to create a consistent development environment, streamlining the setup process and ensuring uniformity across development stages.
